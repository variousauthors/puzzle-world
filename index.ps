RULES
======

( TODO )

( boulder rolling onto log )
  ( tries to roll the log away from the knob )

( BUGS )

( push standing log into water, log does not resolve into knob log )

( PLAYER )

[ > player | object ] -> [ > player impulse | impulsed object ]

( can walk over bridges )
horizontal [ > player | water no BridgeH ] -> [ player | water ]
vertical [ > player | water no BridgeV ] -> [ player | water ]

( can's step off bridges wrong )
horizontal [ > player BridgeV ] -> [ player BridgeV ]
vertical [ > player BridgeH ] -> [ player BridgeH ]

( can walk behind rocks lol )
down [ > player rock ] -> [ player rock ]
up [ > player | rock ] -> [ player | rock ]

( PHYSICS )

( transfering force )
