RULES
======

( TODO )
( add trees )
( no walking over rock bridge, only sending objects )


( BUGS )
( should be able to send object over boulder bridge )

( PLAYER )

[ > player | obstacle ] -> [ > player impulse | impulsed obstacle ]

( PHYSICS )

[ impulse | impulsed obstacle | sink ] -> [ | > obstacle | sink ]

[ impulse | impulsed obstacle | obstacle ] -> [ | obstacle impulse | impulsed obstacle ] again

( OBJECTS )

( TREE )

( push it over )

( LOG )

( roll them )

( BOULDER )

( BOULDER: ROLLING )
[ impulse | impulsed Boulder | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > Boulder impulse | no obstacle ] again

( BOULDER: STATES )
late [ Boulder sink ] -> [ Boulder sinking sink ]
late [ Boulder sinking no DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ] 
late [ Boulder sinking DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ShallowBoulder ] 

( ROCK )

( ROCK: PUSHING )
[ impulse | impulsed rock | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > rock | no obstacle ] again

( ROCK: STATES )
late [ rock sink ] -> [ rock sinking sink ]
late [ rock sinking no DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ]
late [ rock sinking DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ShallowBoulder ]

( END OBJECTS )

( PHYSICS: AFTER )

( keep the impulsed tag with the moving object )
[ impulsed > obstacle ] -> [ > impulsed > obstacle ]
( stop player from moving into obstacles that were blocked )
[ > player | stationary obstacle ] -> [ player | obstacle ]
( remove impulse after map edge stops obstacle )
[ impulse | impulsed stationary obstacle ] -> [ | obstacle ]


( RENDER )
late up [ no Player | PlayerTop  ] -> [ | ] 
late up [ Player | no PlayerTop  ] -> [ Player | PlayerTop ] 

late up [ no Tree | TreeTop  ] -> [ | ] 
late up [ Tree | no TreeTop  ] -> [ Tree | TreeTop ] 

( ROLLING BOULDER )
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ]
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ]
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderA ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ]

late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ]
late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ]
late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderA ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ]

late [ BoulderM ] -> [ BoulderA ]

( ROLLING VERTICAL )
late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderA ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ]

late [ BoulderM ] -> [ BoulderA ]

late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ]

late [ BoulderM ] -> [ BoulderB ]
