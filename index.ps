RULES
======

( TODO )
( add trees )
( no walking over rock bridge, only sending objects )


( BUGS )
( should be able to send object over boulder bridge )

( PLAYER )

[ > player | object ] -> [ > player impulse | impulsed object ]

( can walk over bridges )
horizontal [ > player | water no BridgeH ] -> [ player | water ]
vertical [ > player | water no BridgeV ] -> [ player | water ]

( can's step off bridges wrong )
horizontal [ > player BridgeV ] -> [ player BridgeV ]
vertical [ > player BridgeH ] -> [ player BridgeH ]

( can walk behind rocks lol )
down [ > player rock ] -> [ player rock ]
up [ > player | rock ] -> [ player | rock ]

( PHYSICS )

[ impulse | impulsed object | solidobject ] -> [ | object | solidobject ]

([ impulse | impulsed object | sink ] -> [ | > object | sink ])

( transfering force )
startloop
[ > heavyobject | bridge sink ] -> [ > heavyobject | > bridge sink ]

[ impulse | impulsed lightobject | lightobject ] -> [ | lightobject impulse | impulsed lightobject ] again

[ impulse | impulsed heavyobject | lightobject ] -> [ | heavyobject impulse | impulsed lightobject ] again

[ impulse | impulsed heavyobject | heavyobject ] -> [ | heavyobject impulse | impulsed heavyobject ] again
endloop

( OBJECTS )

( TREE )

( push it over )
horizontal [ impulse | impulsed Tree | no obstacle ] -> [ | stump impulsed > LogH | no obstacle ]
vertical [ impulse | impulsed Tree | no obstacle ] -> [ | stump impulsed > LogV | no obstacle ]

( LOG )

( push it over )
horizontal [ impulse | impulsed LogUp | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > LogH | no obstacle ]
vertical [ impulse | impulsed LogUp | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > LogV | no obstacle ]

( roll them )
vertical [ impulse | impulsed LogH | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > LogH impulse | no obstacle ] again
horizontal [ impulse | impulsed LogV | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > LogV impulse | no obstacle ] again

( stand them up )
( exception: shove into water )
horizontal [ impulse | impulsed LogH | no obstacle sink ] -> [ | impulsed > LogH | no obstacle sink ]
vertical [ impulse | impulsed LogV | no obstacle sink ] -> [ | impulsed > LogV | no obstacle sink ]

horizontal [ impulse | impulsed LogH | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > LogUp | no obstacle ]
vertical [ impulse | impulsed LogV | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > LogUp | no obstacle ]

( exception: put them back on the stump )
horizontal [ > player | logH | stump ] -> [ > player | > LogUp | stump ]
vertical [ > player | logV | stump ] -> [ > player | > LogUp | stump ]

( LOG: STATES )
late [ LogH sink ] -> [ BridgeH sink ]
late [ LogV sink ] -> [ BridgeV sink ]

( BOULDER )

( BOULDER: ROLLING )
[ impulse | impulsed Boulder | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > Boulder impulse | no obstacle ] again

( BOULDER: STATES )
late [ Boulder sink ] -> [ Boulder sinking sink ]
late [ Boulder sinking no DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ] 
late [ Boulder sinking DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ShallowBoulder ] 

( ROCK )

( ROCK: PUSHING )
[ impulse | impulsed rock | no obstacle ] -> [ | impulsed > rock | no obstacle ] again

( ROCK: STATES )
late [ rock sink ] -> [ rock sinking sink ]
late [ rock sinking no DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ]
late [ rock sinking DeepBoulder ] -> [ DeepBoulder ShallowBoulder ]

( END OBJECTS )

( PHYSICS: AFTER )

( keep the impulsed tag with the moving object )
[ impulsed > object ] -> [ > impulsed > object ]
( stop player from moving into obstacles that were blocked )
[ > player | stationary object ] -> [ player | object ]
( remove impulse after map edge stops obstacle )
[ impulse | impulsed stationary object ] -> [ | object ]
( remove impulse after pushing a rock or knocking over a tree )
[ impulsed stationary object ] -> [ object ]


( RENDER )
late up [ no Player | PlayerTop  ] -> [ | ] 
late up [ Player | no PlayerTop  ] -> [ Player | PlayerTop ] 

late up [ no Tree | TreeTop  ] -> [ | ] 
late up [ Tree | no TreeTop  ] -> [ Tree | TreeTop ] 

late up [ no LogUp | LogUpTop  ] -> [ | ] 
late up [ LogUp | no LogUpTop  ] -> [ LogUp | LogUpTop ] 

( ROLLING BOULDER )
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ]
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ]
late right [ impulse | impulsed BoulderA ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ]

late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ]
late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ]
late left [ impulse | impulsed BoulderA ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ]

late [ BoulderM ] -> [ BoulderA ]

( ROLLING VERTICAL )
late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderA ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderD ]

late [ BoulderM ] -> [ BoulderA ]

late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderM ]
late vertical [ impulse | impulsed BoulderB ] -> [ impulse | impulsed BoulderC ]

late [ BoulderM ] -> [ BoulderB ]
